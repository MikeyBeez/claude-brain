# Brain Init Instructions - READ AFTER BRAIN_INIT

You've successfully initialized your Brain session! Here's what to do next.

## ✅ Initialization Complete

The `brain_init` command has:
- Created a new session
- Loaded your preferences (if set)
- Retrieved recent memories
- Prepared the system for use

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Check Your Context
```
brain_status { "detailed": true }
```
This shows:
- Total memories stored
- Memory categories
- Recent activity

### 2. Review Critical Information
If you have critical reminders, they were displayed during init. 
To check reminders anytime:
```
check_reminders { "priority": "critical" }
```

### 3. Load Your Last Project (Optional)
```
state_get { "key": "last_project" }
```

### 4. Start Working!
You're ready to use all Brain tools:
- `brain_remember` - Store information
- `brain_recall` - Search memories
- `brain_execute` - Run code
- `obsidian_note` - Manage notes
- And many more!

## 🔍 Understanding Your Context

The Brain system maintains several types of context:
- **Memories**: Long-term storage (survives between sessions)
- **State**: Session and project data (categorized storage)
- **Notes**: Obsidian vault integration
- **Reminders**: Important items to track

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use descriptive keys** when storing memories:
   ```
   brain_remember {
     "key": "project_awesome_api_design",
     "value": { "status": "planning", "deadline": "2025-08-01" }
   }
   ```

2. **Search is flexible** - partial matches work:
   ```
   brain_recall { "query": "api" }
   ```

3. **Organize with types**:
   - `type: "project"` for project data
   - `type: "pattern"` for reusable patterns
   - `type: "general"` for everything else

## 🚨 Important Notes

- All memories persist between sessions
- State data can be temporary (session/cache)
- Your Obsidian vault is your extended memory
- Regular backups are recommended

Ready to build something amazing! 🚀
