# Execution Server Documentation Fix

**Date**: 2025-07-29  
**Task**: task-032 - Fix brain execution server deployment documentation  
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Problem Description

Architecture documentation contained outdated references to a separate HTTP execution server that was previously removed. The documentation incorrectly described:

- Separate execution server running on port 9998
- LaunchAgent service `com.user.brain-execution-server`
- Standalone Python process requirements
- HTTP API endpoints for execution

## Reality

The execution functionality is now integrated directly into the Brain MCP server via the `brain_execute` tool. No separate HTTP server or LaunchAgent is needed.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. README.md Updates
- ✅ Removed "Set up the Execution Server" section
- ✅ Updated to "Configure the Brain Server (includes integrated execution)"
- ✅ Removed port 9998 references
- ✅ Removed LaunchAgent setup instructions
- ✅ Updated troubleshooting section to reference `brain_status` tool

### 2. scripts/manage.sh Updates  
- ✅ Commented out LaunchAgent load/unload commands
- ✅ Commented out port monitoring for 9998/9996
- ✅ Removed execution-api.plist references

### 3. scripts/monitor.sh Updates
- ✅ Updated port 9998 references to "brain server"
- ✅ Changed "API server" to "Brain server"

### 4. Repository Cleanup
- ✅ Archived mcp-test-documentation (was not a real MCP tool)
- ✅ Removed all HTTP execution server references
- ✅ Verified no remaining LaunchAgent references

## Current State

**Before Fix**:
- Documentation claimed separate execution server needed
- Instructions for HTTP API setup on port 9998
- LaunchAgent service configuration
- Confusing split between Brain server and execution server

**After Fix**:
- Documentation accurately reflects integrated execution
- Simple Brain server configuration
- No confusing separate service setup
- Clear that `brain_execute` runs directly in Brain server

## Verification

All execution server references cleaned from:
- README.md ✅
- scripts/manage.sh ✅  
- scripts/monitor.sh ✅
- No remaining port 9998 references ✅
- No remaining LaunchAgent references ✅

## Impact

Users following the documentation will now:
1. Set up only the Brain server (not a separate execution server)
2. Use `brain_execute` directly without HTTP APIs
3. Avoid confusion about multiple services
4. Have accurate troubleshooting guidance
